HTML Project 

This project was created for the purpose of showcasing different multimedia content as part of a Portfolio website of some sort such as Video Game Walkthroughs for specific games, Television Show and Film Guides for specific shows and films as well. 
The technology leveraged that was used to conduct this project was HTML, CSS and Javascript Programming while also using the Bootstrap Framework, all programmed through the Microsoft Visual Code platform. 
This project begins by first including an Index page with links to each type of multimedia content in the main navbar, as well as an About page. Under each nav link, you can see the different games, television shows and films that are showcased. As of this moment, mostly only video game walkthroughs exist for a few games. 
This project is ongoing as I am continuously updating and improving it on a time to time basis. It is also recommended to view the webpage on a Desktop PC as I am currently trying to figure out how to optimize it for laptop screens and mobile devices. 
I do not know exactly what I am going to name it or the exact purpose it serves, but I am confident that upon completion, I will have an idea of how to proceed with the basics of the webpage.
